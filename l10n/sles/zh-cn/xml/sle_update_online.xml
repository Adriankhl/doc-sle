    SUSE offers an intuitive graphical and a simple command line tool to
    upgrade a running system to a new service pack. They provide support
    for <quote>rollback</quote> of service packs and more. This chapter
    explains how to do a service pack upgrade step by step with these tools.

  <title>Conceptual Overview</title>

  <para>
   SUSE releases new service packs for the SUSE Linux Enterprise family at regular intervals.
   To make it easy for customers to migrate to a new service pack and minimize
   downtime, SUSE supports migrating online while the system is running.

   Starting with SLE 12, YaST Wagon has been replaced by
   YaST migration (GUI) and Zypper migration (command line). This has the
   following advantages:

  <title>Service Pack Migration Workflow</title>

  <para>
   A service pack migration can be executed by either YaST,
   <command>zypper</command>, or AutoYaST.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before you can start a service pack migration, your system must be
   registered at the SUSE Customer Center or a local RMT server.  SUSE Manager can
   also be used.
  </para>

  <para>
   Regardless of the method, a service pack migration consists of the following
   steps:
  </para>

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Find possible migration targets on your registered systems.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Select one migration target.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>

    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Run the migration.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>



  <para>
   The list of migration targets depends on the products you have installed and
   registered. If you have an extension installed for which the new SP is not
   yet available, it could be that no migration target is offered to you.
  </para>

  <para>
   The list of migration targets available for your host will always be
   retrieved from the SUSE Customer Center and depend on products or extensions installed.

  <title>Canceling Service Pack Migration</title>

  <para>
   A service pack migration can only be canceled at specific stages during the
   migration process:
  </para>

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Until the package upgrade starts, there are only minimal changes on the

  <title>Upgrading with the Online Migration Tool (YaST)</title>

  <para>
   To perform a service pack migration with YaST, use the <guimenu>Online
   Migration</guimenu> tool. By default, YaST does not install any packages
   from a third-party repository. If a package was installed from a third-party
   repository, YaST prevents packages from being replaced with the same
   package coming from SUSE.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Reduce Installation Size</title>
   <para>
    When performing the Service Pack migration, YaST will install all recommended
    packages. Especially in the case of custom minimal installations, this may
    increase the installation size of the system significantly.

      <para>
       If more than one migration target is available for your system, Zypper
       allows you to select one SP from the list. This is the same as skipping
       one or more SPs. Keep in mind, online migration for base

   If your system is not registered because you do not have access to the
   Internet or a registration server, migrating to a new service pack is not

   <title>Installation Sources</title>

    This migration path requires you to provide the installation sources for

     Get a list of packages that currently do not have a repository assigned to

     This needs to be done with all repositories that are enabled. You may want

     When the migration has finished and the system has booted into the new
     service pack version, run the check for orphaned packages again:
    </para>
    <screen><prompt>tux &gt; </prompt><command>sudo</command> zypper packages --orphaned</screen>
    <para>
     Compare the new list with the one you generated before starting the
     migration. If new packages appear in the list, it may be because they were
     moved to a different module in the new service pack. If you did not have
     that module in the previous installation, the package did not get updated.
    </para>

     You can check to which module a package belongs at <link xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/packages"/>. Add the missing modules
     using <command>zypper addrepo</command> or the YaST Software
     Repositories module, and update the orphaned packages afterwards by
     running:

  <title>Rolling Back a Service Pack</title>

  <para>
   If a service pack does not work for you, SUSE Linux Enterprise supports reverting the system
   to the state before the service pack migration was started. Prerequisite is
   a Btrfs root partition with snapshots enabled (this has been the default since SLES 12). See <xref linkend="cha-snapper"/> for details.
  </para>

  <procedure xml:id="pro-upgrade-online-rollback">
   <step>
    <para>
     Get a list of all Snapper snapshots:
    </para>
    <screen><prompt>tux &gt; </prompt><command>sudo</command> snapper list</screen>
    <para>
     Review the output to locate the snapshot that was created immediately
     before the service pack migration was started. The column
     <guimenu>Description</guimenu> contains a corresponding statement and the
     snapshot is marked as <literal>important</literal> in the column
     <guimenu>Userdata</guimenu>. Memorize the snapshot number from the column
     <guimenu>#</guimenu> and its date from the column
     <guimenu>Date</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Reboot the system. From the boot menu, select <guimenu>Start boot loader
     from a read-only snapshot</guimenu> and then choose the snapshot with the
     date and number you memorized in the previous step. A second boot menu
     (the one from the snapshot) is loaded. Select the entry starting with
     SLES <phrase role="productnumber"><phrase os="sles;sled">15 SP2</phrase></phrase> and boot it.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     The system boots into the previous state with the system partition mounted
     read-only. Log in as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> and check whether you have chosen the
     correct snapshot. Also make sure everything works as expected. Note that
     since the root file system is mounted read-only, restrictions
     in functionality may apply.
    </para>
    <para>
     In case of problems or if you have booted the wrong snapshot, reboot
     and choose a different snapshot to boot from—up to this point no
     permanent changes have been made. If the snapshot is correct and works as
     expected, make the change permanent by running the following command:
    </para>
    <screen><prompt>tux &gt; </prompt><command>sudo</command> snapper rollback</screen>
    <para>
     Reboot afterward. On the boot screen, choose the default boot entry to
     reboot into the reinstated system.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Check if the repository configuration has been properly
     reset. Furthermore, check if all products are properly registered. If
     either one is not the case, updating the system at a later point in time
     may no longer work, or the system may be updated using the wrong package
     repositories.
    </para>
    <para>
     Make sure the system can access the Internet before starting
     this procedure.

      <para>
       Carefully check the output of this command. No services and repositories
       that were added for the update should be listed. For example, if you
       are rolling back from SLES15 SP1 to SLES15, the list must
       contain the <literal>SLES15</literal> repositories, and not the 
       <literal>SLES15-SP1</literal> repositories.
      </para>
      <para>
       If wrong repositories are listed, delete them and, if
       necessary, replace them with the versions matching your product or
       service pack version. For a list of repositories for the supported
       migration paths refer to <xref linkend="sec-upgrade-background-modules"/>. (Note that manual intervention should not be necessary,
       as the repositories should be updated automatically, but it is a
       best practice to verify and make any necessary corrections.)       
      </para>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       Last, check the registration status for all products installed by
