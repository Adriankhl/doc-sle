  <title>Considerations for Deployment of a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</title>

  <para>
   The implementation of an operating system either in an existing IT
   environment or as a completely new roll out must be carefully prepared. At
   the beginning of the planning process, you should try to define the project
   goals and necessary features. This must always be done individually for each
   project, but the questions to answer should include the following:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     How many installations should be done? Depending on this, the best
     deployment methods differ.

     Do you need help for your local installation? SUSE provides training,

  <title>Deployment of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</title>

  <para>
   To make sure that your system will run flawlessly, always try to use
   certified hardware. The hardware certification process is an ongoing process
   and the database of certified hardware is updated regularly. Find the search
   form for certified hardware at
   <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/yessearch/Search.jsp"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Depending on the number of desired installations, it is beneficial to use
   installation servers or even completely automatic installations. When using
   Xen or KVM virtualization technologies, network root file systems or
   network storage solutions like iSCSI should be considered.
  </para>

  <para>
   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server provides you with a broad variety of services. Find an overview of the
   documentation in this book in <xref linkend="pre-sle"/>. Most of the
   needed configurations can be made with YaST, the SUSE configuration
   utility. In addition, many manual configurations are described in the
   corresponding chapters.
  </para>

  <para>
   In addition to the plain software installation, you should consider training
   the end users of the systems and help desk staff.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Terminology</title>
   <para>
    In the following sections, the system to hold your new <phrase role="productname"><phrase os="sles">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase></phrase>
    installation is called <emphasis>target system</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>installation target</emphasis>. The term
    <emphasis>repository</emphasis> (previously called <quote>installation
     source</quote>) is used for all sources of installation data. This
    includes physical media, such as CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, and network
    servers distributing the installation data in your network.
   </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-planning-running">
  <title>Running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</title>

  <para>
   The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server operating system is a well-tested and stable system.
   Unfortunately, this does not prevent hardware failures or other causes for
   downtime or data loss. For any serious computing task where data loss could
   occur, a regular backup should be done.
  </para>

  <para>
   For optimal security and data safety, you should make regular updates of all
   the operated machines. If you have a mission critical server, you should run
   a second identical (pre-production) machine that you can use to test all
   changes. This also gives you the possibility of switching machines in the
   case of hardware failure.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-planning-registering">
  <title>Registering <phrase role="productname"><phrase os="sles">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase></phrase></title>

  <para>
   To get technical support and product updates, you need to register and
   activate your SUSE product with the SUSE Customer Center. We recommend to register during
   the installation, since this will enable you to install the system with the
   latest updates and patches available. However, if you are offline or want to
   skip the registration step, you can register at any time later from the
   installed system.
  </para>

  <para>
   In case your organization does not provide a local registration server,
   registering SUSE Linux Enterprise requires a SUSE Customer Center account. In case you do not have one yet,
   go to the SUSE Customer Center home page (<link xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/"/>)
   to create one.
  </para>

  <para>
   During the installation you will be asked to enter your registration code.
   For details, see <xref linkend="sec-yast-install-scc-registration"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you deploy your instances automatically using AutoYaST, you can register the
   system during the installation by providing the respective information in
   the AutoYaST control file. For details, see
   <xref linkend="CreateProfile-Register"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   For registering an already installed system, see
   <xref linkend="sec-yast-software-register"/>.

    If you are installing onto a computer or VM that has access to the Internet,
    then to install any of the products listed above, it is only necessary to
    download the <filename>SLE-15-SP2-Online-<replaceable>ARCH</replaceable>-GM-media1.iso</filename> image for the desired

    <title>Installing SUSE Manager</title>

      The size of the full installation media SLE-15-SP2-Online-<replaceable>ARCH</replaceable>-GM-media1.iso exceeds the
      capacity of a dual layer DVD.  Therefore you can only boot it from a USB
      flash drive.
