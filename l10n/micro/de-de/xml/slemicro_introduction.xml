    SUSE® Linux Enterprise Micro allows upgrading from an existing system to the new version. No
    new installation is needed. Existing data, such as home and data
    directories and system configuration, is kept intact.

<para>
    Upgrades between two releases of <phrase role="productname"><phrase os="slemicro">SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro</phrase></phrase> are supported by SUSE.
    Whether it is better to upgrade or perform a fresh installation depends on
    your specific scenario. While upgrades involve less work, fresh
    installations ensure you benefit from all the new features of a release
    such as disk layout changes, specific filesystem features, and other
    improvements. To get the most out of your system, SUSE therefore
    recommends fresh installations in most scenarios.
   </para>

   <para>
    In both cases—upgrade as well as a fresh installation—customers
    need to check if system settings and default values still fit their
    requirements.
