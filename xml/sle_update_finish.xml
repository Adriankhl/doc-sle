  <title>Post-upgrade checks</title>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Check for any <quote>orphaned packages</quote>.
     During an upgrade procedure, packages may be renamed, removed, merged, or split.
     As a result, certain packages can become orphaned and unsupported.
     Orphaned packages are not automatically removed.
     The following command gives you a list of these:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.user;zypper packages --orphaned --unneeded</screen>
    <para>
     Use the list to determine which packages are still needed and which packages
     can be safely removed.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Check for any <filename>*.rpmnew</filename> and
     <filename>*.rpmsave</filename> files, examine their content, and possibly
     merge desirable changes.  When an upgrade includes changes to a default
     configuration file, instead of overwriting the configuration file, the
     package creates one of these file types. While
     <filename>*.rpmnew</filename> contains the new default configuration and
     leaves your original file untouched, <filename>*.rpmsave</filename> is a
     copy of your original configuration that has been replaced by the new
     default file.
    </para>
    <para>
     You do not need to search the whole file system for
     <filename>*.rpmnew</filename> and <filename>*.rpmsave</filename> files,
     the most important are stored in the <filename>/etc</filename>
     directory.  Use the following command to list them:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.user;find /etc -print | egrep "rpmnew$|rpmsave$"</screen>

  <title>Enable the <literal>Python 3</literal> module</title>
  <para>
   &productname; 15 uses Python 3.6 by default. Python 3.9 was added in
   &productnameshort; 15 SP3 as a more recent alternative. This version is no
   longer supported as of &productnameshort; 15 SP4. Instead, recent Python
   versions with important updates and security fixes are available through the
   <literal>Python 3</literal> module.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you installed Python 3.9 under &productname; 15 SP3, enable the
   <literal>Python 3</literal> module with:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>SUSEConnect -p sle-module-python3/&product-ga;.&product-sp;/<replaceable>x86_64</replaceable></command>.</screen>
  <para>
   Alternatively, you can return to the default Python version by removing 3.9
   with <command>zypper remove -u python39</command>.
  </para>
